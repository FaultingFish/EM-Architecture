# view/ — local setup (deployment-specific)

You are working in the View app of a 3-app EMFI research platform. View is the **unified dashboard** — pure SvelteKit static, talks to Control + Develop over HTTP + WebSocket, owns no state of its own.

## Where this runs

| | |
|---|---|
| Host | `faultierHost2` at `10.164.9.112` (Kali rolling 2025.4, amd64) |
| User | `stephen` |
| Repo | `/home/stephen/EM-Architecture/` |
| SSH alias | `ssh em-lab` |
| Node | 20.19.5, npm 11.13.0 |
| URL | `http://10.164.9.112:8003/` |
| Production build output | `view/build/` (already produced; static files only) |

## Services this app consumes

Both live on the same lab box.

| Service | URL | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| Control | `http://10.164.9.112:8001/` | hardware state, campaigns, campaign metadata, runs, heatmap/cell drill-down, arm gate, motion, shouter, flash. WS `/ws`: `position`, `arm`, `counter`, `attempt`, `device_status`, `campaign_progress`, `state`, `error` |
| Develop | `http://10.164.9.112:8002/` | firmware projects, builds, disassembly, glitch-targets. WS `/ws`: `build_log`, `build_status`, `agent_output` |

URLs are configurable at build time:

```bash
VITE_CONTROL_URL=http://10.164.9.112:8001 \
VITE_DEVELOP_URL=http://10.164.9.112:8002 \
npm run build
```

For local dev against the lab box, `vite.config.ts` already has proxy entries — change `target` to `http://10.164.9.112:800{1,2}` if you want hot-reload on your laptop pointing at real services.

## How you actually run this app

```bash
ssh em-lab
cd ~/EM-Architecture/view

bash start.sh            # ./start.sh — production preview on 0.0.0.0:8003
                         # OR
npm run dev -- --port 8003 --host 0.0.0.0   # hot reload
npm run build            # static build → ./build/
npm run preview -- --port 8003 --host 0.0.0.0  # serve the static build
```

`start.sh` will produce a build if `./build/` is missing, then `vite preview` it.

Verify:
```
curl -I http://10.164.9.112:8003/        # HTTP 200, index.html
```

## State this app needs to receive correctly

All four stores hydrate from Control's WS `/ws`:

| Store | WS topic | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `arm.ts` | `arm` | `{ armed, seconds_until_auto_disarm }` |
| `position.ts` | `position` | `{ x, y, z, machine_x?, machine_y?, machine_z? }` |
| `counters.ts` | `counter` | `{ attempts, glitches, hangs, crashes, nothings, campaigns }` |
| `log.ts` | `attempt` (append) | cap at 200 latest `AttemptResult` |
| `devices.ts` | `device_status` | `Map<name, DeviceStatus>` |

If you change envelope shapes in `src/lib/ws/control_ws.ts`, post in `agentConversation.md` so the Control session keeps in sync.

## Hardware *that exists right now* (informational; you don't talk to it)

| Device | Path | Identity |
|---|---|---|
| ChipShover | `/dev/ttyACM0` (Marlin) | position roughly `(0, 11, 216.5)` after homing |
| ChipSHOUTER | `/dev/ttyUSB1` | NewAE, id `5LY0MB:2.0.3`, disarmed |
| Scaffold | `/dev/ttyUSB0` | Ledger, fw 0.9 |
| XDS110 | `/dev/ttyACM1`+`/dev/ttyACM2` | TI debug probe |

You'll mostly care about these for what the user *sees* — make sure DeviceStatusCard renders all four sensibly even when one is unavailable.

The Husky crowbar path is scaffolded in Control but not live hardware control
yet. View should not present dual-target/Husky campaigns as operational until
Control has real Husky connect/configure/pulse behavior and per-slot flashed
provenance.

## Safety UX — non-negotiable

Documented in `SPEC.md` § Safety UX, summarized here:

1. **ArmButton requires hold-to-arm**: 1000 ms default (read from Control's `/arm_state.auto_disarm_seconds` for the disarm window).
2. **StopButton is permanent**: floating, always reachable. Listens for **Esc** and **Space** globally.
3. **Arm indicator is always visible in the header.** Red when armed, gray when safe. Auto-disarm countdown ticks down beside it.
4. **No silent failures.** If a Control call returns an error, surface it as a toast — don't swallow.

The user can hurt themselves and the hardware with this UI. Don't move these safeguards behind any debug-mode toggle.

## Typed clients

Once Control and Develop emit OpenAPI schemas (regen target in `protocol/openapi/`), generate types:

```bash
npx openapi-typescript ../protocol/openapi/control.yaml -o src/lib/api/control.types.ts
npx openapi-typescript ../protocol/openapi/develop.yaml -o src/lib/api/develop.types.ts
```

Don't hand-maintain types in parallel — drift will bite you within a week.

## Cross-app communication

Append-only `agentConversation.md` at the repo root. Use it when:
- You add a new page that needs a new endpoint or WS topic from Control/Develop
- You change the shape you expect from a WS event (so the Python side can update emitter accordingly)
- You discover that an endpoint returns a different shape than `SPEC.md` says

## Out of scope (Phase 2)

USB camera overlay, click-to-jog calibration, cross-rig comparison, multi-user state. File ideas, don't implement.

## When in doubt

- `SPEC.md` — authoritative pages + components + stores contract
- `AUDIT.md` — initial scaffold audit findings
- `../ARCHITECTURE.md` — system rationale
- `../agentsNotes.md` — repo-wide notes for AI sessions
- Drop a note in `../agentConversation.md` if you need something from Control or Develop
